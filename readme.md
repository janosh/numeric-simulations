# Fundamentals of Simulation Methods

These are solutions written in C to example sheets handed out in [Prof. Volker Springel's](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/prof-dr-volker-springel) lecture on the fundamentals of simulation methods. This lecture was held at the physics department of Heidelberg University in the fall of 2015.

The PDFs in each folder can also be [viewed here](https://janosh.dev/physics/numeric-simulations).
