# Fundamentals of Simulation Methods

These are solutions to example sheets handed out in [Prof. Volker Springel's](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/prof-dr-volker-springel.html) lecture on the fundamentals of simulation methods. This lecture was held at Heidelberg University's physics department in the fall of 2015.

In contrast to [my website](https://janosh.io/physics/numeric-simulations), where you can find these same PDFs, this repo also contains all code.
